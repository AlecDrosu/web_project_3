# Project 3: From Portland to Portland

### Overview
* Intro
* Figma
* Images

**Intro**

This is a project about traveling across the US. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

Good luck and have fun!

This will me my first attempt at completing the project, it was definetely way harder at completing. Some things were quite easy to implement like display: grid, but getting the objects to enlarge properly between the required screen sizes became a challenge. There are some problems, I was a bit confused on what exactly had to be specified in pixels, and what had to be specified in fractions on other relative units. This was because on the brief, the only value they give are in pixels. I was trying at one point to specify all the values in various percents, but it became essentially guess-and-check to find what percent was the closest to that given pixel value. Because of this I specified many of them in terms of pixels. In order to fix this, I will ask my tutor how to go about getting to an accurate relative unit, and if just guessing the right percent value would be accepted.
